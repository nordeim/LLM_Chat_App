Let’s approach this task systematically, breaking it down into several steps to ensure a robust, user-friendly, and modern LLM chat application with a Gradio-based web UI. The goal is to transform the provided Python script into a fully functional, interactive web application with enhanced features, proper markdown rendering, and clipboard functionality, while maintaining code quality through validation and testing.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Current Code

The provided sample code is a basic Python script that:
- Queries a deployed Mistral model via an API endpoint (`http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`).
- Uses a hardcoded system prompt, user prompt, temperature, and model.
- Returns the model’s response in JSON format and prints it to the console.
- Has no UI or interactivity.

Key limitations:
1. **No UI**: The script runs in the console, making it inaccessible to non-technical users.
2. **Hardcoded Parameters**: Parameters like `base_url`, `model`, `system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens` are not configurable without editing the code.
3. **No Error Handling for UI**: While there is basic error handling for API responses, there’s no user-friendly error display.
4. **No Markdown Rendering**: The response is printed as raw text, not rendered as HTML from markdown.
5. **No Clipboard Functionality**: There’s no way to copy input or output text.
6. **No Scrollable Text Boxes**: Large inputs or outputs would be cumbersome to view in a UI without scrolling.

### Step 2: Define Requirements for the Improved Application

Based on the task, the improved application must:
1. **Use Gradio for Web UI**: Provide an attractive, intuitive, and modern web interface.
2. **Editable Input Fields**: Allow users to edit:
   - `base_url` (API endpoint, e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`).
   - `model` (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503`).
   - `system_prompt` (a large text area for the system prompt).
   - `user_prompt` (a large text area for the user prompt).
   - `temperature` (a slider or numeric input, typically between 0 and 1).
   - `max_tokens` (a numeric input, e.g., 1 to 4096).
3. **Output Display**: Display the LLM response in a scrollable box, rendering markdown as HTML.
4. **Clipboard Functionality**: Add "Copy to Clipboard" buttons for both input and output boxes, copying the raw markdown text (not rendered HTML).
5. **Modern and Intuitive Design**: Ensure the UI is attractive, with clear labels, proper layout, and responsive design.
6. **Robustness**: Include error handling, input validation, and proper API response parsing.
7. **Testing and Validation**: Double-check and validate the implementation to ensure it works as expected.

### Step 3: Explore Implementation Options

To achieve these requirements, let’s explore various implementation options for key components:

#### 3.1: Gradio UI Components
Gradio is a Python library that allows quick creation of web-based interfaces. We need to choose appropriate Gradio components for each input and output field:
- **Text Inputs (`base_url`, `model`)**: Use `gr.Textbox` for single-line text inputs.
- **Large Text Inputs (`system_prompt`, `user_prompt`)**: Use `gr.Textbox` with `lines=10` to create a scrollable, multi-line text area.
- **Numeric Inputs (`temperature`, `max_tokens`)**:
  - For `temperature`, a `gr.Slider` is intuitive, with a range of 0 to 1 and a step size of 0.01.
  - For `max_tokens`, a `gr.Number` input is better, allowing users to type or use up/down arrows, with a reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 4096).
- **Output Display**: Use `gr.Markdown` to render the LLM response as HTML from markdown. However, `gr.Markdown` does not natively support scrolling, so we may need to wrap it in a custom HTML component or use CSS to enable scrolling.
- **Buttons**: Use `gr.Button` for the "Submit" button (to send the query) and "Copy to Clipboard" buttons.

#### 3.2: Markdown Rendering
The LLM response is in markdown format, and we need to render it as HTML in the UI. Options:
- **Option 1: Use `gr.Markdown`**: Gradio’s `gr.Markdown` component automatically renders markdown as HTML. This is the simplest option, but we need to ensure it supports scrolling for large outputs.
- **Option 2: Use `gr.HTML` with a Markdown Library**: Use a Python markdown library (e.g., `markdown`) to convert markdown to HTML, then display it in a `gr.HTML` component. This gives more control over rendering but requires additional dependencies.
- **Preferred Choice**: Use `gr.Markdown` for simplicity, as it handles markdown rendering natively. To enable scrolling, we can use Gradio’s `height` parameter or custom CSS.

#### 3.3: Clipboard Functionality
We need to copy the raw markdown text (not rendered HTML) to the clipboard. Options:
- **Option 1: Use Gradio’s Built-in Clipboard Support**: Gradio does not natively support clipboard functionality, so we need custom JavaScript.
- **Option 2: Use Custom JavaScript in `gr.HTML`**: Embed a button with JavaScript to copy text to the clipboard using the `navigator.clipboard` API. We can store the raw markdown text in a hidden element or pass it to JavaScript.
- **Option 3: Use a Third-Party Library**: Use a library like `pyperclip` for clipboard functionality, but this is not suitable for web applications (it works in desktop environments).
- **Preferred Choice**: Use custom JavaScript with `navigator.clipboard` in Gradio, as it’s web-friendly and doesn’t require additional dependencies.

#### 3.4: API Integration
The API integration needs to be robust, with proper error handling and user feedback. Options:
- **Option 1: Keep Existing `requests` Implementation**: The current code uses `requests.post` to query the API. This is simple and effective but lacks timeout handling and detailed error messages.
- **Option 2: Use `aiohttp` for Asynchronous Requests**: Gradio supports asynchronous functions, so we could use `aiohttp` for non-blocking API calls. This is more complex and may not be necessary for a single API call.
- **Preferred Choice**: Enhance the existing `requests` implementation by adding timeout handling, better error messages, and input validation.

#### 3.5: Error Handling and User Feedback
We need to display errors in the UI (e.g., API failures, invalid inputs). Options:
- **Option 1: Use Gradio’s `gr.Error`**: Raise a `gr.Error` to display an error message in the UI. This is user-friendly but may not allow custom formatting.
- **Option 2: Display Errors in the Output Box**: Display error messages in the same output box as the LLM response, formatted as markdown (e.g., `**Error:** ...`). This keeps all feedback in one place.
- **Preferred Choice**: Use Option 2, as it provides a consistent user experience and allows custom formatting of error messages.

#### 3.6: UI Layout and Design
The UI should be attractive and intuitive. Options:
- **Option 1: Single Column Layout**: Place all inputs and outputs in a single column. This is simple but may not use screen space efficiently.
- **Option 2: Two-Column Layout**: Place inputs on the left and outputs on the right. This is more modern but may not work well on narrow screens.
- **Option 3: Tabbed Layout**: Use Gradio’s `gr.Tab` to separate input configuration (e.g., `base_url`, `model`) from the chat interface (`system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, output). This is more complex but provides a cleaner interface.
- **Preferred Choice**: Use a single column layout for simplicity and responsiveness, grouping related inputs together with `gr.Group` and `gr.Accordion` for a modern look.

### Step 4: Choose the Best Implementation Approach

Based on the exploration, the best implementation approach is:
- **Gradio UI**: Use `gr.Textbox`, `gr.Slider`, `gr.Number`, `gr.Markdown`, and `gr.Button` for inputs and outputs, with custom CSS for scrolling.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Use `gr.Markdown` for simplicity, with custom CSS to enable scrolling in the output box.
- **Clipboard Functionality**: Use custom JavaScript with `navigator.clipboard` to copy raw markdown text, integrated via `gr.HTML`.
- **API Integration**: Enhance the `requests` implementation with timeout handling, input validation, and detailed error messages.
- **Error Handling**: Display errors in the output box as markdown.
- **UI Layout**: Use a single column layout with `gr.Group` and `gr.Accordion` for grouping and a modern, intuitive design.

---

### Step 5: Design the Improved Application

Let’s outline the structure of the improved application:
1. **Main Function (`query_model`)**: Enhance the existing function to accept `base_url`, `model`, `system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens` as parameters, with timeout handling and detailed error messages.
2. **Gradio Interface**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - `base_url`: `gr.Textbox`
     - `model`: `gr.Textbox`
     - `system_prompt`: `gr.Textbox` (multi-line, scroll

The current date is {today}.

When you're not sure about some information, you say that you don't have the information and don't make up anything.
If the user's question is not clear, ambiguous, or does not provide enough context for you to accurately answer the question, you do not try to answer it right away and you rather ask the user to clarify their request (e.g. "What are some good restaurants around me?" => "Where are you?" or "When is the next flight to Tokyo" => "Where do you travel from?").
You are always very attentive to dates, in particular you try to resolve dates (e.g. "yesterday" is {yesterday}) and when asked about information at specific dates, you discard information that is at another date.
You follow these instructions in all languages, and always respond to the user in the language they use or request.
